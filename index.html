I'm an <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science</a> PhD student at Cornell University working in natural language processing. My advisor is <a href="https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/">David Mimno</a>.
<br><br>
I completed my master's degree at the University of Washington, where I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/">Fei Xia</a>, and I've previously worked at <a href="https://www.pnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> (PNNL) and <a href="https://www.maana.io/">Maana</a>, a data analytics startup.

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
I'm interested in natural language processing and machine learning techniques that help me learn about people. I work a lot with unsupervised semi-supervised techniques, and I employ methods like word embeddings and topic modeling to solve problems of semantic similarity (e.g. synonym and paraphrase detection) and to explore datasets ranging from healthcare to digital humanities.
