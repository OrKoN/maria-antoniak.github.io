I'm an <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science</a> PhD student at Cornell University working in natural language processing. My advisor is <a href="https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/">David Mimno</a>.
<br><br>
I have a master's degree in computational linguistics from the University of Washington, where I was advised by <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/fxia/">Fei Xia</a>, and I've previously worked at <a href="https://www.pnl.gov/">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> (PNNL) and <a href="https://www.maana.io/">Maana</a>, a data analytics startup.

<b>Research Interests</b>
<br>
My research is in natural language processing and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques, such as word embeddings and topic modeling. I study how these techniques can be used to explore new datasets (ranging from healthcare to digital humanities) and solve problems of semantic similarity (e.g. synonym and paraphrase detection).
