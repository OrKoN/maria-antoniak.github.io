Hi! I'm Maria.
<br>
I'm a PhD student at Cornell University working with David Mimno. I completed my master's degree at the University of Washington, where I studied synonym detection with Fei Xia. I've worked previously at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Maana, a data analytics startup.
<br>
My research interests include:
<br>
- unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
- semantic similarity, especially synonym and paraphrase detection
