# Machine Learning with Words: A Python Primer

333

My goal is to get you running a machine learning pipeline on your own dataset as quickly as possible. I want you to experience the magic of machine learning and start building cool things.

You don’t need any background in machine learning to follow this primer, but I’ll assume that you know enough programming to understand my Python snippets.


## Requirements

Everything you need is contained in [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview).

If you prefer to download things manually, you'll need Python 2.7 and the following Python packages:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* gensim
* spaCy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

You install all of those packages using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).

I also recommend installing [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to make debugging a bit easier. You can use a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (included with Anaconda) to write and run your code interactively.


## Find a dataset

You can use any text dataset you like. I’ll be using a collection of Shakespeare plays from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

To make your first project easier, you might want to choose a dataset with the following qualities:

* machine-readable text (.txt or .csv files, not PDF)
* 1,000-100,000 documents
* a topic that is familiar to you


## Load and clean your dataset

A **document** is a unit within your dataset. How big should it be? That's up to you! A document might be one sentence, one paragraph, one chapter, one tweet, one book...

Use _pandas_ to load your data and divide it into documents.

{% highlight python %}
    import pandas as pd

    pd.load_csv('/path/to/your/documents')
{% endhighlight %}

Clean the documents by removing numbers and punctuation, lowercasing the text, and removing words that occur fewer than N times.

```python
def remove_non_alpha(text):
    return re.sub('[^A-Za-z\s]', ' ', text)

def preprocess_text(text, stopwords=None):
    text = text.lower()
    text = remove_non_alpha(text)
    return text
```

## Create feature vectors.

A [feature vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector) is a machine readable representation of a single document. It includes a list of **features** (words) and **values** (word frequencies). You could add extra features, such as the year or author, but for now, we’ll just use words and their frequencies.

When working with text, there are some important things to consider when creating your feature vectors:

* Some of your documents are different lengths, so the frequency of a word within the document isn't comparable to its frequency in other documents.

* A few words occur very frequently and are distributed (somewhat) evenly across all documents (e.g. *the*, *and*, *she*). We call these [stopwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words).

* Many words  are rare (they only occur a few times). This is known as the [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail).

To solve these problems, we'll ignore rare words when constructing our features, and we'll weight our feature values using [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (term frequency-inverse document frequency).

Luckily, this is all very easy if we use **scikit-learn** to create our feature vectors.

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf=True, min_df=10, sublinear_tf=True)
vectorizer = vectorizer.fit(documents)
vectorizer.transform(documents)
```

By specifying `min_df=10` we've required that each word occur in at least 10 documents. This eliminates rare words from our features.

How it works: TF-IDF weights the word frequencies


## Cluster your dataset

Ok, time for some magic!

Let's ask the computer to _cluster_ your dataset. Clustering means gathering the documents into groups based on their similarity.

How it works: K-means searches for
