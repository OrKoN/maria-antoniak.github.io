# Machine Learning with Words: A Python Primer

This is a quick start primer to machine learning techniques for text data. You don't need any background in machine learning to follow this primer, but I'll assume that you know enough programming to understand my Python snippets.

My goal is to get you running a machine learning pipeline on your own dataset as quickly as possible. I want you to experience the magic of machine learning and start building cool things.

## Requirements

You will need Python 2.7 and the following Python packages:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* gensim
* spaCy
* matplotlib
* seaborn

If you are new to Python (or feeling lazy), I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview), which includes all of the above packages and is awesome.

I also recommend installing [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to make debugging a bit easier. Alternately, you can use a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to write and run your code (included with Anaconda). Jupyter notebooks are popular in data science and provide an interactive coding experience. You can even run them within PyCharm!

If you want to use Python 3, go for it! Just be aware that some of my code will need minor alterations to run.


## Find a dataset

You can use any dataset you like, as long as it contains a lot of machine-readable text. I recommend finding some plain .txt or .csv files to start. I'll be using a collection of Shakespeare plays from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).


## Load and clean your dataset

Use **pandas** to load your data.

Clean the documents by removing numbers and punctuation, lowercasing the text, and removing words that occur fewer than N times.

```python
def remove_non_alpha(text):
    return re.sub('[^A-Za-z\s]', ' ', text)

def preprocess_text(text, stopwords=None):
    text = text.lower()
    text = remove_non_alpha(text)
    return text
```

Transform the documents into feature vectors. A feature vector is a list of **features** (words) and **values** (word counts).


## Cluster your dataset

Ok, time for some magic!

Let's ask the computer to **cluster** your dataset. Clustering means gathering the documents into groups based on their similarity.


```python
```
