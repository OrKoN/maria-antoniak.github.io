# Machine Learning with Words: A Python Primer

If you're curious about machine learning and want to get started coding as quickly as possible, this primer is for you! My goal is to get you running a machine learning pipeline on your own dataset.

You don’t need any background in machine learning to follow this primer, but I’ll assume that you know enough programming to follow my Python snippets.

<br><br>

## Requirements

If you're new to Python, everything you need is contained in [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview). Download the version for Python 3.6.

Optional: I also recommend installing [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to make writing and debugging your code a bit easier. You can use a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (included with Anaconda) to write and run your code interactively.

If you already have Python, you'll need Python 3.6 and the following Python packages:

* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
* [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
* [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You can install all of those packages using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/).

## Find a dataset

You can use any text dataset you like. I’ll be using a collection of Shakespeare plays from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

To make your first project easier, you might want to choose a dataset with the following qualities:

* machine-readable text (.txt or .csv files, not PDF)
* 1,000-100,000 documents
* a topic that is familiar to you

<br><br>

## Load and clean your dataset

A **document** is a unit within your dataset. A document might be one sentence, one paragraph, one chapter, one tweet, one book... The size is up to you!

Use **pandas** to load your data and divide it into documents.

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd

pd.load_csv('/path/to/your/documents')
{% endhighlight %}

Clean the documents by removing numbers and punctuation and lowercasing the text.

{% highlight python %}
def remove_non_alpha(text):
    return re.sub('[^A-Za-z\s]', ' ', text)

def preprocess_text(text, stopwords=None):
    text = text.lower()
    text = remove_non_alpha(text)
    return text
{% endhighlight %}

<br><br>

## Create feature vectors.

A [feature vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector) is a machine readable representation of a document. It includes a list of **features** and **values**. The values can indicate whether a feature is present or how important it is. For text documents, feature vectors usually consist of words (features) and their frequencies (values). The intuition is that if a word occurs more often in a document, it usually means that the word is important.

For example, the sentence *A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.* can be transformed into the following feature vector:

| a  | be  | but  | fool  | himself | knows | man  | thinks  | to  | wise  |   
|----|-----|------|-------|---------|-------|------|---------|-----|-------|
| 3  | 2   | 1    | 2     | 2       | 1     | 1    | 1       | 2   | 2     |

Unfortunately, using just the words and frequencies can result in some errors. Here are a few problems to consider:

* Documents have different lengths, so the frequency of a word within one document might not be comparable to its frequency in another document. For example, if a word occurs 10 times in a document of length 20, it is probably more important than a word that occurs 10 times in a document of length 200.

* Some words occur very frequently and are distributed (somewhat) evenly across all documents (e.g. *the*, *and*, *she*). We sometimes call these [stopwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words). Although they have high frequencies, they are usually not significant since all documents have these words.

* Many, many words occur only a few times in the entire dataset. This is known as the [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail). These words simply don't occur frequently enough to tell us anything useful, and they also explode our feature space (the more features you have, the slower your algorithm will run).

Luckily, we can solve many of these problems by using some simple hacks (remove stopwords and rare words) and weighting our feature values using [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). TF-IDF compares the **term frequency** (the frequency of a word in the current document) to the **document frequency** (the distribution of the word across all the documents in the dataset).

This can all be done very easily if we use **scikit-learn** to create our feature vectors.

{% highlight python %}
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(norm=l2, use_idf=True, min_df=10, sublinear_tf=True)
vectorizer = vectorizer.fit(documents)
vectorizer.transform(documents)
{% endhighlight %}

Let's break that down a bit:
* By specifying `min_df=10` we've required that each word occur in at least 10 documents. This eliminates rare words from our features.
* By specifying `use_idf=True`, we say that yes, we want to use the document frequency to weaken the effect of frequent words that occur in most of the documents and strengthen the effect of words that occur less frequently but in specific documents.
* By specifying `sublinear_tf=True`, we scale the feature values so that very frequent features don't overwhelm the vectors.
* By specifying, `norm=l2`, we normalize the vectors to remove the bias introduced by different document lengths.

## Cluster your dataset

Let's ask the computer to **cluster** your dataset. Clustering means gathering the documents into groups based on their similarity.

How it works: K-means searches for
